## v0.0.1

  - Removed `install_load_packages`. Replace with 
  [`pacman` (github link)](https://github.com/trinker/pacman).


## v0.0.0.9004

Note: I downgraded the version number from 0.0.1 to 0.0.0.9004 because this package
is not a stable or final release and is still under active development.

  - Added NEWS (this document).

  - Updated `format_pval` to allow optional suppression of leading zeros and to
  use significant digits (e.g., .010 instead of 0.01).
  
  - Updated `make_forest_plot` to place axis labels within `labs()` section
  instead of as `xlab` and `ylab`.
  
  - Deprecated `install_load_packages`. Replace with 
  [`pacman` (github link)](https://github.com/trinker/pacman).
  
  - README updated to credit authors of functions I have borrowed and modified.
