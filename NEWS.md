v0.0.0.9010
-----------

Note: I downgraded the version number from 0.0.1 to 0.0.0.9004 because
this package is not a stable or final release and is still under active
development.

-   Added NEWS (this document).

-   Updated `format_pval` to allow optional suppression of leading zeros
    and to use significant digits (e.g., .010 instead of 0.01).

-   Updated `make_forest_plot` to place axis labels within `labs()`
    section instead of as `xlab` and `ylab`.

-   Removed `install_load_packages`. Replace with [`pacman` (github
    link)](https://github.com/trinker/pacman).

-   README updated to credit authors of functions I have borrowed and
    modified.
